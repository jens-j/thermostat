- take the difference between the heater water temperature and the room temperature?
  this makes the system closer to an integrating system.

- check remote parameter availability (dhw temp and max ch temp)

- when a receive error is encountered, the receive function should keep trying to receive for the duration of the response time.

- only update iTerm in the proportional band

- document opentherm and heater functions 

- cmd using rpc call so the server can log command events
